Eric Li is a designer and software engineer based in New York. 

I spent 3+ years as a Senior Product Designer and Developer at the [Museum of Modern&nbsp;Art](https://www.moma.org/). I also teach interaction design and computer science at [RISD](http://source.f22.href.blue/) and [Parsons](https://js.f22.href.blue/). I often collaborate with [Nazlı Ercan](https://nazli-ercan.com/) under the name [<nobr>Ercan–Li</nobr>](https://ercan-li.com/).

Prior to MoMA, I worked at <nobr>[O-R-G](https://o-r-g.com/)</nobr>, [Google&nbsp;Design](https://design.google/), [IDEO](https://ideo.com/), and [LUST](https://lust.nl/).

I graduated with a B.S.E. in computer science and visual arts from Princeton, where I was the 2018 recipient of the Jim Seawright Award in Visual Arts. I have been an invited guest to classes at Princeton, Yale, NYU, SVA, TCNJ, Pratt, CCA, and UPenn.
