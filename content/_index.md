I’m currently a design engineer at [Notion](http://notion.com/) and teach computer science at [Parsons](https://js.f24.href.blue/).

With over 10 years of experience building products, my focus on design led engineering and product has allowed me to make significant impact at organizations like the [Eames Institute](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/), [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/), [Google](https://design.google/), and [IDEO](https://ideo.com/).
