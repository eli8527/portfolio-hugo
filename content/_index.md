My focus on design led engineering and product has allowed me to make significant impact at organizations like the [Eames Institute](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/), [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/), [Google](https://design.google/), and [IDEO](https://ideo.com/).

With over 9 years of experience building products, Iâ€™m currently focused on creating something new at [Orchard Analytics](https://www.orchardanalytics.co/) and also teach computer science at [Parsons](https://js.f24.href.blue/).
