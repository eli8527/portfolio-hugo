<!-- sure, why not. this website is the culmination of many attempts to keep a history of myself and my work on the web. it will probably not be the last attempt either. to be brief, it is written in as pared down a way as possible, with <abbr title="well, i tried my best, but still had to make a few adjustments.">almost</abbr> no additional styling or scripting. i am interested in how tools shape our lives — and in this case, the [tool](https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/677#:~:text=These%20interface%20elements,into%20the%20background.) is the web browser and how it provides [defaults](https://linedandunlined.com/archive/default-systems-in-graphic-design/) for us to interact with.

i am a designer and software developer based in new york. i most recently worked at [MoMA](https://www.moma.org/), making the website and focusing on design strategy. it is a bit more fancy than this one. i also do my own stuff. you can find a more detailed bio [here](/about/).

**i am currently looking for full-time design roles. you can find some more information about my work and an up to date resumé at my [read.cv](https://cv.eric.young.li/) or in my [bio](/about/).**

here, you can eventually find a somewhat complete archive of my work. i am in the slow process of updating it. you can also find me on [e-mail](mailto:ericyoungli@gmail.com), [are.na](https://www.are.na/eric-li), [twitter](https://twitter.com/eli8527), and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eli8527/). -->
