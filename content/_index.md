I spent 3+ years as a Senior Product Designer and Developer at the [Museum of Modern Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlrbBo9xYYU). I&nbsp;also teach interaction design and computer science at [RISD](http://source.f22.href.blue/) and [Parsons](https://js.f22.href.blue/), and am 1/2 of [<nobr>Ercanâ€“Li</nobr>](https://ercan-li.com/).

Prior to MoMA, I worked at <nobr>[O&#8209;R&#8209;G](https://o-r-g.com/)</nobr>, [Google&nbsp;Design](https://design.google/), [IDEO](https://ideo.com/), and&nbsp;[LUST](https://lust.nl/).
