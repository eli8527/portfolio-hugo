  Curated an exhibition at the Broodthaers Society of America, *WRECKED ALPHABET* brought together over forty artists, graphic designers, musicians, and writers whose work engages the alphabet. My essay on Marcel Broodthaers, *On Des!!!gn*, was also featured in this show. Organized with [Joe Scanlan](https://joescanlan.biz/).
