  As Senior Product Designer and Developer at the Museum of Modern Art, I led product design and front end development of the Museum’s many public facing digital surfaces. I was responsible for significant portions of the Museum’s website and digital strategy, including its 2019 redesign, digital signage and wayfinding, the Digital Visitor Guide, redesigning the ticketing flow, Single Sign On, stewarding the digital design system, in-gallery interactives, and COVID visitor journeys. All my work was done in collaboration with the amazing folks on the Digital Products team.
