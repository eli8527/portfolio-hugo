  While a part of the Museum’s Creative Team, I led product design and front end development of the Museum’s public facing digital surfaces. I was responsible for significant portions of the Museum’s website and digital strategy, including our 2019 redesign, the Digital Visitor Guide, redesigning our ticketing flow, Single Sign On, our digital design system, in-gallery interactives, and COVID visitor journeys.
