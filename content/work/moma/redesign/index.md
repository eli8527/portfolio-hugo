Designed, built, and shipped visual and UX changes to moma.org, as part of our 2019 redesign. Continued to work very closely with Graphic Design to ensure and consistent brand expression and accessibility in our new visual language, and championed good design across the Museum with other collaborators.

With [Michael Fehrenbach](https://michaelfehrenbach.com/), built Sol a bespoke Atomic CSS library that includes our core design system metrics.
