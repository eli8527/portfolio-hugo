MoMA’s artist pages are often seen as a canonical record of that artist’s life. In 2021, our content and education teams worked with us to explore ways to spruce up our artist and art term pages, as well as increase discoverability.

We started by performing user surveys on these pages to understand how our audience was using our product. Combined with other user research tools like Hotjar and Analytics, we were able to present to our stakeholders some initial findings to direct our inception.

In our inception, our [Jackie Cruz](http://jackiecruz.me/) and I facilitated the definition of goals, antigoals, and risks as well as the creation of user stories. With the rest of the team and stakeholders, we aligned our stories on an effort/impact chart and priced out stories.

[Stephanie Schapowal](https://stephanieschapowal.com/) and I approached this project pragmatically, deploying from our kit of parts what we could, and adding new feature development only when necessary. As part of this project, we also updated the design of these pages from our older, Made Thought era, design to the one we established in 2019.

Since MoMA’s brand is so visually expressive, we drew the line that on reference pages, full bleed images would not be used. This would elevate our more “marketing” pages at a higher level in brand expression. Our work also introduced back links and an autogenerated Table of Contents which could be reused elsewhere on our site.

{{< figure src="design-detail.png" screenshot="true" class="plain" mat="#eee" caption="Design detail of the refreshed pages" >}}

To aid in discoverability, we also added images on our artist index page, a redesigned search field, and the ability to sort by random. We also added a component for exploring other artists if your search query turned up empty. Since not all the artists in our collection had gotten an editorial pass, we made sure to only link to those pages with content.
