As part of the 2019 expansion, MoMA introduced a suite of 31 digital screens interspersed throughout the Museum. These digital screens served as digital wayfinding in concert with the screenprinted signage. I was co-lead developer on implementing the designs of these screens in Vue, pulling from our CMS to render constantly up to date information. I also worked closely with design to tighten up the screens prior to the reopening of the Museum.
