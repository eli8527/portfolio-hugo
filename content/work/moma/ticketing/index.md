MoMA’s collection pages are often seen as canonicals record of their topics, often appearing in the top search result for the artist or art term. In 2021, our content and education teams worked with us to explore ways to spruce up our existing artist and art term pages, as well as increase discoverability. 

Using data gathered from user feedback and surveys, I led a redesign of our artist and art term collection pages. Our goal was to make the individual pages more dynamic and open, providing users with more ways to learn beyond just text. We also revisited our index pages for these sections, adding features for discoverability and surfacing new content. As part of this pass, we also did a visual design pass to bring this experience in line with our new brand expression.
