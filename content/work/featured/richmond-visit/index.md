The [Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/) opened its Archives to the public for the first time in March 2024. To prepare for this, I led the Digital Product team in creating a holistic user journey, guiding our audience from initial awareness through ticket purchase and post-visit engagement.

Many times, a product and platform can be useful forcing functions to rapidly coalesce around a shared execution strategy. With the Archives, we used the Visit page to hone in key business decisions such as pricing, frequency, and positioning.

As part of the project kick off, we also aligned on several goals and antigoals:

**Goals**

- Ease of use and visual beauty to the page
- Strong and compelling storytelling to introduce and get people excited about the space
- A central resource for visitors planning a visit to have their questions answered
- A peek into all the other amazing programming and collection that we have
- The ability to purchase something from us

**Antigoal**

- Replicating features and functionality of other parts of the site (e.g. collection, future eComm)

I also proposed several personas for leadership to align on core functionality and features for launch, which was only several months away. This allowed us make decisions which empathized with our potential audience.
