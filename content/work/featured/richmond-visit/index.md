### The [Eames Institute of Infinite Curiosity](https://www.eamesinstitute.org/) opened its Archives to the public for the first time in March 2024. To prepare for this, I led the Digital Product team in creating a holistic user journey, guiding our audience from initial awareness through ticket purchase and post-visit engagement.

Many times, a product and platform can be useful forcing functions to rapidly coalesce around a shared execution strategy. With the Archives, we used the Visit page to hone in key business decisions such as pricing, frequency, and positioning.

As part of the project kick off, we also aligned on several goals and antigoals:

**Goals**

- Ease of use and visual beauty to the page
- Strong and compelling storytelling to introduce and get people excited about the space
- A central resource for visitors planning a visit to have their questions answered
- A peek into all the other amazing programming and collection that we have
- The ability to purchase something from us

**Antigoal**

- Replicating features and functionality of other parts of the site (e.g. collection, future eComm)

{{< heading-anchor title="Personas" >}}

I also proposed several personas for leadership to align on core functionality and features for launch, which was only several months away. We introduced a few more in our workshop. This process allowed us make aligned and informed decisions for our future audience.

- Local
- Tourist/Visitor
- Archivist/Academic
- Corporate
- Non-local
- The +1

{{< figure src="personas.png" screenshot="true" class="plain" mat="#eee" caption="A collaborative set of personas helped us ensure we were always building for our audience and not for ourselves." >}}

{{< heading-anchor title="Audience Requirements" >}}

I facilitated an exercise based on these personas in which the participants mapped out:

- **What are the tasks that each user might need to complete?**
- **What information would be useful for them?**

Through an affinity mapping process, this output was consolidated into several broad categories that we felt all personas required in order for the digital experience to be a success.

- Booking Info
- FAQ
- What to do in the area
- Ongoing digital engagement
- Contact touchpoints

{{< figure src="affinity.png" screenshot="true" class="plain" mat="#eee" caption="There was a lot of overlap across the personas, allowing us to prioritize feature and copy based on audience needs." >}}

### Through another round with a smaller group, we arrived on a final information architecture for the experience. By aligning on the IA first, we could then hone our focus on visual and user experience design with a clear scope and list of requirements.

One thing that became clear through this process was a need to define several crucial aspects of the tour -->
