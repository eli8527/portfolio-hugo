description: |
  I teach in the graduate program at the Rhode Island School of Design as a Critic in Graphic Design and in the undergraduate and graduate programs at Parsons as a Part-time Lecturer. My courses focus on interaction design, graphic design, and software engineering. I ask students to consider their role as designers in our constantly shifting visual culture.
