  David Reinfurt and I wrote a series of three essays titled *When It Changed* which anchored the first [Are.na Annual](https://store.are.na/products/annual-book). Edited by Meg Miller, these essays explore the slow perversification of our relationship with technology and suggests ways for rescuing ourselves by way of ambient software.
